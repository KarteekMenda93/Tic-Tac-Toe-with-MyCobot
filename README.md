# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-MyCobot

The myCobot 280 m5 is a cobot which I use in this project for making the cobot play the tic tac toe. Tic-tac-toe is a classic twoplayer game played on a 3x3 grid. The cobot with its capabilities
plays the tic tac toe with users. The project is all about employing the best move so that the cobot wins and this can be achieved by employing a decision-making algorithm (minimax algorithm) which
is generally used in two player turn games. Overall, this algorithm is used in game theory to minimize the loss in the worst-case scenario. The cobot with its capabilities needs to be integrated with the
necessary logic of the above algorithm so that it can mimic the decision taken by the algorithm in its turn.
